title: Don't Buy Me Stuff
redirect_from: "/wishlists/"

Over the many Christmases, Birthdays, and other occasions I've accumulated many
things I don't necessarily need. I'm in a very fortunate position, with a stable
job, and I can afford to buy the things I need or want myself. To that end, I
politely request that people do not buy me stuff.

Instead, I follow the lead of a good friend of mine, and request that you simply
do something nice for somebody else, or donate to a charity or non-profit of
your choice (I personally support [Anthony Nolan](https://www.anthonynolan.org/),
[Cancer Research UK](https://www.canceresearchuk.org/) and the
[British Heart Foundation](https://www.bhf.org.uk), but you should donate to any
charity you choose)

Once you have done that, write me a card or a letter. Tell me what you did, or
who you donated to (and why). Tell me a story about us. Tell me of a memory that
we share. Give me some advice. Tell me what you **really** think of me ;).
